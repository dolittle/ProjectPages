Bifrost has been written with specifications supporting and guaranteeing the quality of the code, this instead of using more traditional unit tests. 

As with all code in Bifrost, you will find small specialized specifications. These are written in a specifying way using the Gherkin construct (given, when, then) found in [Behavior Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development).
